# Arduino implementation of the Project
This Autonomous vehicle is realised using 3 ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) and Motor Driver of 2A current rating. The car was modelled using Arduino Software. The Documentaion can be found [here](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/jake/how-to-use-an-ultrasonic-sensor-with-an-arduino-63527b) 
# Distance and Angle Measurement using GPS
Using the haversine formula [here](https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html) and Cartesian coordinate system . Also you can find the documentation on bearing [here](https://www.igismap.com/formula-to-find-bearing-or-heading-angle-between-two-points-latitude-longitude/)
